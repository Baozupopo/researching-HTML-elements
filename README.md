# Leveraging Additional HTML Documentation Resources 

## Problem Statement

As you become familiar with the fundamentals of HTML, you'll get comfortable setting up the
basics of a web document. However, you will notice that some tags that you'll come across 
fall outside of your scope of knowledge. 

We will inevitably come across unfamiliar HTML elements or elements for which we do not fully 
understand the meaning and/or use. The best place to find these answer is the web itself. 

## Objectives

1. Use search engines as resource to find information
2. Observe and identify which resources will contain relevant information
3. Compare mulitple resources to find the most comprehensive information


## Use search engines as resource to find information

We will inevitably come across unfamiliar HTML elements or elements for which we do not fully understand the meaning and/or use. 
The best place to find these answer is the web itself. The open and free documentation on the web gets better every day.

Let's say in your research, you come across an unfamiliar element like `<samp>`. We can google 
`samp html element,` and we will find an endless list of results to choose from. Sometimes 
resources can be outdated, biased, or inaccurate, (like many topics that can be searched 
online) so it's important to filter through the results to find the best fit.

## Observe and identify which resources will contain relevant information

Your instinct may be to check the first result in the search, but bare in mind, that top-
level search results may not always be the most relevant--they just have higher 
`Search Engine Optimazation` rankings, which can be impacting by things such as metadata
and website accessibility, which bump them higher up in the list. If you select the second 
search result, we will view the Mozilla Developer Network (**likely the best HTML, JS and 
CSS documentation source on the internet**) documentation for the `<samp>` element.

The [Mozilla Developer Network HTML reference guide](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element) is a very robust, trusted 
resource, constantly being updated with past, present, and pending features in web.

## Compare mulitple resources to find the most comprehensive information

If we go back to the search results, you'll see that the first result in this case 
is `W3schools`. They are a commercial resource that has been around for a very long time. 
In this case, it may serve as a useful tool for cross-referencing new tags and concepts. 
Sometimes you may look at the 
[Mozilla Developer Network HTML reference guide](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element) 
to find the names and functions of tags you want to implement, but the definition or example you're given 
doesn't feel like enough for you to understand its purpose and how to use it. A site like 
W3schools can be used as an additional resource for garnering understanding, and even 
includes interactive examples, creating a sandbox environment for experimentation.

## Conclusion

The web is a constantly evolving entity. As we build more ambitious products or learn from 
our collective needs and mistakes, the industry continually evolves the HTML specification by 
adding new elements or deprecating legacy elements. Researching and referencing documentation 
or other coding resources can be intimidating at first, but it's a common practice for 
developers and another skillset that you'll become comfortable with over time. Don't be afraid to 
implement these searches--open and free documentation on the web gets better every 
day. It is s normal to not know or fully understand them all!
