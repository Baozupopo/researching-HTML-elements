# Leveraging Additional HTML Documentation Resources 

## Problem Statement

As you become familiar with the fundamentals of HTML, you'll get comfortable setting up basic 
webpages. However, you will notice that some tags that you'll come across fall outside of 
your scope of knowledge. 

We will all inevitably come across unfamiliar HTML elements. Or maybe we'll encounter an element 
that's familiar, but it will be used in a way we don't understand. How are we going to level-up? 
The techniques for searching for technical help are similar to searching for any-old-thing on the 
internet, but we have to be more careful about which sources we trust. This is a skill you will 
build over time, but here are some good guidelines to keep in mind.

## Objectives

1. Use search engines as a resource to find information
2. Observe and identify which resources will contain relevant information
3. Compare multiple resources to find the most comprehensive information


## Use Search Engines as a Resources to Find Information

Let's say in your research, you come across an unfamiliar element like `<samp>`. We can google 
`samp html element,` and we will find an endless list of results to choose from. Sometimes 
resources can be outdated, biased, or inaccurate, (like many topics that can be searched 
online) so it's important to filter through the results to find the best fit.

## Observe and Identify Which Resources Will Contain Relevant Information

When perusing search results, your instinct may be to open the first result, but bear in mind, that top-
level search results may not always be the most relevant--they could have higher 
`Search Engine Optimization` rankings. This can be impacted by things not related to 
the quality of the content itself, which bump the results higher up in the list. We recommend 
that you open the top five results and review the results critically. We also recommend that you 
trust sites that are affiliated with building or defining the technologies, moreso than blogs or other
resources. In the HTML world, the Mozilla Developer Network (MDN) is an extremely trustworthy site. 
In fact, it's likely the best HTML, JS and CSS documentation source on the internet.

## Compare multiple resources to find the most comprehensive information


If we go back to the search results, you'll see that the first result in this case 
is `W3schools`. They are a commercial resource that has been around for a very long time. 
In this case, it may serve as a useful tool for cross-referencing new tags and concepts. 
Even though the [Mozilla Developer Network HTML reference guide](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element) 
is a very robust, and trusted resource, used to find the names and functions of tags, you
may find that the definition or example you're given in the MDN is not enough for you to 
understand its purpose and how to use it. A site, like W3schools, for example, can be used 
as an additional resource for garnering understanding. It even includes interactive examples, 
creating a sandbox environment for experimentation.

## Conclusion

The web is a constantly evolving entity. As we build more ambitious products or learn from 
our collective needs and mistakes, the industry will continually evolve the HTML specifications 
by adding new elements or deprecating legacy elements. Researching and referencing documentation 
or other coding resources can be intimidating at first, but it's a common practice for developers, 
and another skill set that you'll become comfortable with over time. Don't be afraid to implement 
these searches--open source and free resources on the web get better every day. It is s normal to 
not know or fully understand them all!
