# Leveraging Additional HTML Documentation Resources

## Problem Statement

When writing HTML you might tags that that are new to you.

We will all inevitably come across unfamiliar HTML elements. Or maybe we'll encounter an element
that's familiar, but it will be used in a way we don't understand. How are we going to level-up?
The techniques for searching for technical help we have to be careful about which sources we trust. This is a skill you will
build over time, but here are some good guidelines to keep in mind.

## Objectives

1. Use search engines as a resource to find information
2. Observe and identify resources relevant information
3. Compare multiple resources to find the best source


## Use Search Engines as a Resources to Find Information

Let's say in your research, you come across an unfamiliar element like `<samp>`. We can google
`samp html element,` and we will find an endless list of results to choose from. Sometimes
resources can be outdated, biased, or inaccurate, (like many topics that can be searched
online) so it's important to filter through the results to find the best fit.

## Observe And Identify Resources Relevant Information

When reading search results, your instinct may be to open the first result. You should be pickier.  Sometimes the result has "gamed" the search engine. We recommend
that you open the top five results and review thee critically. We also recommend that you
trust sites that are affiliated with building or defining the technologies, more than blogs or other
resources. In the HTML world, the Mozilla Developer Network (MDN) is an extremely trustworthy site.
In fact, it's likely the best HTML, JS and CSS documentation source on the internet.

## Compare Multiple Resources To Find The Best Source


If we go back to the search results, you'll see that the first result in this case
is `W3schools`. They are a commercial resource that has been around for a very long time. A site, like W3schools, for example, can be used
as an additional resource for garnering understanding. It even includes interactive examples,
creating a sandbox environment for experimentation.

## Conclusion

The web is a constantly evolving entity. As we build more ambitious products or learn from
our collective needs and mistakes, the industry will continually evolve the HTML specifications
by adding new elements or deprecating legacy elements. Researching and referencing documentation
or other coding resources can be scary at first, but it's a common practice for developers,
and another skill set that you'll become comfortable with over time. Don't be afraid to implement
these searches--open source and free resources on the web get better every day. It is normal to
not know or fully understand them all!
